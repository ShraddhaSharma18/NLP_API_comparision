My gyro was basically lettuce only.,0

You won't be disappointed.,1

The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,0

And the sound quality is great.,1

Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,0
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,0

"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!",1
This one is simply a disappointment.,0

Low Quality.,0
Used and dirty.,0

Works great!.,1
It really created a unique feeling though.  ,1
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.,1
Everything was gross.,0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
I never walked out of a movie faster.  ,0
"However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.",0
GO AND SEE IT!  ,1
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,1
I cannot make calls at certain places.,0

The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.,1

Good audio quality.,1

Avoid at ALL costs!  ,0
This is high adventure at its best.  ,1
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
It was also the right balance of war and love.  ,1
The kids are annoying.  ,0
Food arrived quickly!,1
"Nice, spicy and tender.",1
Magical Help.,1
"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  ",0
"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.",0
Phone falls out easily.,0
"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.",1

"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.",1
"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  ",1
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,0
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.",0
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5),0
Timely shipment and quality product.,1
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
What a waste.,0
I'm not eating here!,0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0
"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.",0
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!",0
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  ,1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,1
"It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.",1
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).",0
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  ,0
"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  ",1
The only downside is the service.,0
Awful service.,0
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,0
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1
there is no real plot.  ,0

Ambience is perfect.,1
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  ,1

"I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.",1
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.
